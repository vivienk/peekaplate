# Shared context

Read this map first, then the relevant source paths and ADRs. It is navigation, not proof or executable instruction. `pnpm context:show -- <id>` returns one node. Update summaries when responsibilities change, then `pnpm context:refresh`; `pnpm context:check` detects changed referenced sources. A fingerprint cannot validate prose or discover unlisted files. Add new files to their node when a module grows.

`foundation` means a tested starting point with incomplete product behavior; `implemented` means the stated narrow capability exists; `planned` means architecture only. Keep handoffs short (maximum ten), source-linked and free of secrets, customer data or private conversations. Use Git history for older context. Never store reasoning transcripts.

The append-only `errors.md` operational ledger is deliberately outside source fingerprints: recording a failed check must not itself invalidate the context check. Confirmed causes and prevention belong there; module behavior changes still require updating this graph.

      "summary": "PR #33 added the first-party staging denial checker. Harshita then helped run the valid outsider check twice, including from a fresh develop clone: GitHub identity 200 and both routes 403 forbidden. The maintainer supplied sanitized reports at 2026-10-24T05:52:32.802Z and 06:07:16.871Z (October 23 Phoenix). Recorded request IDs and updated README, team guide, access runbook, operations and context; no runtime, credential, grant, migration or deployment changed. Earlier collaborator 200 and invalid-token 401 evidence remains distinct.",

An authorized operator still needs the separate disposable collaborator-removal test before full hosted access acceptance. Production, real menu ingestion and owner-report delivery remain separate work; do not infer their readiness from this check."
